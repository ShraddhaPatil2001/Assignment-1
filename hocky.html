    <h1>Hocky</h1>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <div>Introduced in the Indian army during British rule,hockey attracted the masses so much so that India won a hat-trick of gold medals not once but twice.
        Among the world’s premier sports with an Olympic legacy and featuring blue riband events like the World Cup, 
        Champions Trophy and FIH Pro League, field hockey traces its roots back to the 16th century.One of the most ancient games in the world -- a crude form of the sport was played in Egypt some 4,000 years ago -- the history of hockey can be traced back to 1527 in Scotland.
         Back then, it was called hokie where players hit around a small ball with sticks.However, the first version of modern-day field hockey was developed by the British sometime between the late 18th and early 19th century.
         It was introduced as a popular school game then and made its way to the Indian army during British rule in the 1850s.</div>

         <h2>Rules</h2>
         <div>In a field hockey match, two teams with 11 players each, use specially designed sticks to play for an hour and score goals to win a contest.With roots dating back to 500 BC,
             the origin of field hockey can be traced to the early civilizations of Ancient Greece and Egypt.There are primitive drawings and carvings on walls that depict people playing with a ball and a stick, 
             showing striking resemblance with modern-day hockey.However, the hockey that we see today has witnessed radical changes and the modern game is played in accordance with a set of rules 
             and regulations formulated by the custodians of the game.The hockey rules today are made by the Rules Committee, which works under the governing body of hockey, 
             the Fédération Internationale de Hockey (FIH) or the International Federation of Hockey.</div>
