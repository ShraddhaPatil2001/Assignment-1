<h1> Cricket</h1>
<h2>History</h2>
<div>Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps.
     The batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at the wicket with the bat and then running between the wickets, while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this (by preventing the ball from leaving the field, and getting the ball to either wicket) and dismiss each batter (so they are "out"). Means of dismissal include being bowled, when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side either catching the ball after it is hit by the bat, but before it hits the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the crease in front of the wicket. When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles. 
     The game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a third umpire and match referee in international matches. 
    They communicate with two off-field scorers who record the match's statistical information.Forms of cricket range from Twenty20, with each team batting for a single innings of 20 overs and the game generally lasting three hours, to Test matches played over five days. Traditionally cricketers play in all-white kit, but in limited overs cricket they wear club or team colours. In addition to the basic kit,
     some players wear protective gear to prevent injury caused by the ball, which is a hard, solid spheroid made of compressed leather with a slightly raised sewn seam enclosing a cork core layered with tightly wound string.</div>

<h2>Rule</h2>
<div>Which team will bat or bowl first is decided through the toss. This toss is a simple tossing of a coin, nothing special.
    Regardless of the format, only 11 players can feature in a side.
    A batsman can get out in some of these common ways: Caught, Runout, LBW, Bold, Stump and Hitwicket.The batting team will try and score as many runs as possible in the allotted time whilst the bowling team will try and contain them by fielding the ball. The teams then swap and the second team batting will try and outscore the runs their opponents scored first. If they fail they lose, if they succeed they win.
     Each team is made up of 11 players.</div>
